This code performs image encryption and decryption using pixel-wise manipulation in Python, leveraging the Pillow library for image handling and NumPy for array-based calculations. The approach here uses a randomly generated key to apply bitwise XOR operations to each pixel’s RGB values, ensuring secure encryption that scrambles the image data into an unintelligible format.

Breakdown of the Code:
Encryption Function (encrypt_image):

Loads the input image using Pillow and converts it into a NumPy array to access each pixel's RGB values.
A bitwise XOR operation is applied between the pixel values and a randomly generated key, creating an encrypted version of the image.
The encrypted pixel data is saved as a new image file.
Decryption Function (decrypt_image):

Takes the encrypted pixel data and the same key, reapplying the bitwise XOR operation to reverse the encryption, which restores the original image.
Saves the decrypted image to confirm successful decryption.
Key Generation:

A random key is generated for the encryption, matching the dimensions of the image (width, height, and 3 RGB channels). This key must be securely saved, as it’s required for decryption.
Key Concepts:
Bitwise XOR Operation: The bitwise XOR ensures that applying it twice with the same key restores the original values, making it suitable for both encryption and decryption.
Pixel Manipulation: Working directly with pixel data allows for a straightforward but effective encryption method, making each pixel's values indecipherable without the correct key.
Important Considerations:
This encryption method demonstrates a foundational approach to image security. However, secure storage of the generated key is crucial, as losing it will prevent decryption.
Overall, this code illustrates how basic cryptographic operations can be applied to image data, providing a solid example of Python’s versatility in both data processing and encryption techniques.
